## Title of the Project
## CAMPVOYAGE
The Smart Campus Navigation System is an advanced application designed to help students, staff, and visitors easily find their way around a large educational campus. Using Augmented Reality for real-time path guidance, Virtual Reality for immersive campus exploration, and AI-based image and voice recognition, the system makes navigation simple and interactive. Users can scan buildings, search destinations, or follow AR arrows directly on their screen, while the backend manages updated campus data and 3D models. This project aims to provide a modern, intelligent, and user-friendly solution that transforms traditional campus navigation into a smart digital experience.

## About
The Smart Campus Navigation System is a modern solution designed to help users easily navigate large and complex educational campuses. The project uses Augmented Reality to display real-time arrows and directions on the user’s screen, Virtual Reality to explore the campus in 3D, and AI technologies like image scanning and voice recognition to detect buildings, rooms, and user queries. By integrating 3D models, accurate pathfinding, and a full-stack backend for dynamic data updates, the system ensures that students, staff, and visitors can reach their destinations quickly and confidently. Overall, the project aims to create a smart, interactive, and user-friendly navigation experience that enhances campus accessibility.

## Features
1. AR-Based Real-Time Navigation
Displays live augmented reality arrows, markers, and directions on the user’s mobile screen to guide them accurately around the campus.

2. VR Campus Exploration
Allows users to virtually walk through 3D models of buildings, classrooms, and facilities for remote or pre-visit exploration.

3. Image Scanning & Recognition
Uses AI-based image detection and OCR to recognize building names, room numbers, and signboards from camera input.

4. Voice Command Search
Supports hands-free navigation where users can speak destinations like “Go to Library” or “Find Classroom 203.”

5. Dynamic Route Correction
If users take a wrong turn, the system immediately recalculates and updates the AR path to get them back on track.

6. 3D Modeling of Campus Buildings
Includes detailed 3D models of classrooms, labs, corridors, and important campus locations for immersive visualization.

7. Full-Stack Backend with Admin Control
The admin panel enables staff to update buildings, add new rooms, modify routes, and manage 3D model data in real time.

9. Indoor & Outdoor Navigation Support
Uses GPS outdoors and camera/AI-based tracking indoors for precise navigation across all campus environments.

10. User-Friendly Interface
Simple and intuitive design that makes it easy for new visitors, students, and parents to navigate the campus.

## Results and Impact
The Smart Campus Navigation System successfully provides an interactive and intelligent guiding experience for users within the campus. The implemented AR module accurately overlays real-time directional arrows on the mobile screen, enabling users to follow the correct path visually. The VR component delivers a detailed 3D virtual walkthrough of classrooms, buildings, and facilities, helping new students and visitors explore the campus even before physically arriving. AI-based image scanning correctly identifies buildings and room numbers, while voice recognition allows effortless, hands-free searching of destinations. The backend efficiently manages campus data and updates, ensuring that routes and building information remain accurate. Overall, the system demonstrates strong performance with smooth navigation, accurate detection, and a user-friendly interface, proving its effectiveness as a smart navigation solution for modern campuses.
